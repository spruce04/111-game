Game Rules
- The goal is to reach 111 (one hundred and eleven - or eleventy-one) points before all others do.
- A single die is used to play the game.
- Each player is allowed as many rolls as they want, except when they roll a "1" (one), their round ends.
- The points are accumulated during a player's round, but if a player rolls a "1" (one), they lose all the points that they accumulated during the round.
